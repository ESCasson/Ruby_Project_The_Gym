Git repo: Add a README.md file to your git repo. It should be added to the root of your repo and it will be displayed on the repoâ€™s front page like this: https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme. The README should contain:
running instructions for your applications (so other people can clone it and run it)
your brief
the technologies you used
it can also contain screenshots!
